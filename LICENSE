Developer Addendum to Photobucket.com Terms of Use Agreement

Updated: 4/21/2008

This addendum ("Developer Addendum") to the Photobucket.com Terms of Use Agreement ("Photobucket Agreement") which is available at http://photobucket.com/terms as may be updated by Photobucket from time to time, will apply in addition to the Photobucket Agreement with respect to your use of Photobucket’s application development services, including without limitation, the Developer Platform ("Developer Service"). The Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum set forth legally binding terms for your use of the Developer Service. Any capitalized terms used in this Developer Addendum not otherwise defined will have the meaning assigned to them in the Photobucket Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Developer Service is a "Photobucket Service" as defined by the Photobucket Agreement and therefore all references to "Photobucket Services" in the Photobucket Agreement will apply to your use of the Developer Service. In the event of a conflict between this Developer Addendum and the Photobucket Agreement, this Developer Addendum will govern you use of the Developer Service. By accessing and/or using the Developer Service you agree to be bound to the terms of the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum. The term "Developer" hereunder refers to a Member that has accessed and/or used the Developer Service. You are only authorized to use the Developer Service (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("Applicable Law"), the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum. Please read the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum carefully. If you do not agree to be bound by both this Developer Addendum and the Photobucket Agreement and to follow all Applicable Law, you should discontinue use of the Developer Service immediately.

If you wish to make use of the Developer Service, you must indicate your acceptance of the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum during the Developer application creation process. In order to use the Developer Service, you may be required to download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions. You may receive a copy of the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum by emailing us at: devtourequest@photobucket.com, Subject: Developer Addendum. The Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum include Photobucket’s policy for acceptable use of the Developer Service and any content posted on or through the Developer Service and your rights, obligations and restrictions regarding your use of the Developer Service and content posted on or through the Developer Service. Photobucket may modify the Photobucket Agreement or this Developer Addendum from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon posting by Photobucket on the Photobucket Website. Your continued use of the Developer Service after Photobucket posts a revised Photobucket Agreement and/or Developer Addendum signifies your acceptance of such revised Photobucket Agreement and/or Developer Addendum. It is therefore important that you review the Photobucket Agreement and this Developer Addendum regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.

Definitions.

1.1  "Developer Platform" means the software and supporting materials that enable a Developer to develop applications to interface with the Photobucket Services and may allow such applications to retrieve data provided by Photobucket relating to Users ("User Information"), retrieve Content as authorized from Users or provide Content from Photobucket Applications to Photobucket.

Even after your Developer status and/or access to the Developer Service has terminated, this Developer Addendum and the Photobucket Agreement will remain in effect, except that all rights granted hereunder shall immediately terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that Photobucket is under no obligation to delete or to ask its users to delete your Photobucket Application Content that has been incorporated into other aspects of the Photobucket Services, for example, within Photobucket profiles, and therefore such Photobucket Application Content may continue to appear and be used indefinitely.
